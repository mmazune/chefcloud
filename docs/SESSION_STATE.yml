notes: |
  Phase C is cleanup-focused.
  C1 = registry only (no deletions).
  C2 = high-confidence deletions (proven unreferenced).
  C3.1 = quarantine WIP (zero production imports).
  C3.2 = import firewall enforcement.
  C4 = medium-confidence improvements (optional).
  DO NOT break existing functionality.
